# Can TV Advertising Predict Sales?

## Summary

This project investigates whether **TV advertising spending can predict product sales** using a simple linear regression model.

## The Questions Explored

### Which features to use?

For this project, I focused exclusively on **TV advertising** as the predictive feature. This decision aligns with the assignment instructions, aiming for a model that is both simple and highly focused on the direct relationship between TV ad spend and product sales.

### Which Type of Linear Regression to use?

I utilized **Single Linear Regression**. This choice was made because the primary objective was to predict product sales based on the influence of a single independent variable: TV advertising expenditure.

### How considering more predictor variables will affect our answer?

Incorporating additional predictor variables would likely lead to **more accurate and robust product sales predictions**. While TV ad spending alone demonstrates a positive correlation with sales, sales are undoubtedly influenced by a multitude of other factors. These could include:
* Radio advertising spend
* Newspaper advertising spend
* Product pricing strategies
* Seasonality (time of year)
* Broader market trends and competitive actions

By analyzing a broader set of these variables, the model could provide a more comprehensive and realistic understanding of the true drivers behind product sales, rather than solely attributing changes to TV advertising.

## Final Analysis

As a Machine Learning researcher at Company XYZ, I managed the entire machine learning pipeline for this project. This included:
* Data loading and initial exploration.
* Data visualization to understand relationships.
* Building the linear regression model.
* Evaluating and interpreting the model's results.

The Python code developed for this analysis runs correctly, providing clear and actionable insights. Adhering strictly to the assignment's instructions, which stipulated the use of only TV advertising data, the analysis revealed a **clear positive relationship between TV ad spending and product sales**. This strong correlation suggests that increased investment in TV advertising is associated with a corresponding increase in product sales.
